    "text": "What strategies effectively dismantle structural racism and quell racially motivated violence? Research on structural racism proposes multiple paths towards decreasing race disparities. However, the effectiveness of these recommendations is largely empirically unsubstantiated because of the dismal track record of dismantling racism in the United States.\nTo address these questions, we employ a computational approach combined with in depth case analysis to construct the first longitudinal database on racism and strategies to combat racism world-wide. With attention to the theoretical tenets for addressing racism and under standing minority agency and innovation in face of racial inequity, this extensive collection of empirical evidence situates African Americans, Asian American-Pacific Islanders (AAPI), and Latinx Americans in a larger cross-national group-level database, supplemented with sub-national case study data from across the world."

PNAS Nexus. 3(5):165.\nSCAR aims to build a unique large scale database using new computational methods and supplement at-scale data collection with important national level case studies.\nThe foundational AMAR data (All Minorities at Risk) is the most extensive cross-national longitudinal data collection in the world about minorities, their actions and treatment by the state. The data contains variables that will allow us to begin to explore varying discrimination and its correlates cross-nationally (Birnir et.al. 2018).\nWe will apply the method to sort through large amount of information to code for political actions and treatment of over 1,200 AMAR groups. The development will also address theoretical issues that come with a fluid group-level variable like ethnicity. Once refined at the aggregate level this method can be applied at the sub-national level to gather nuanced local level data in local languages."
