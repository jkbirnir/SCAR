    "text": "What strategies effectively dismantle structural racism and quell racially motivated violence? Research on structural racism proposes multiple paths towards decreasing race disparities. However, the effectiveness of these recommendations is largely empirically unsubstantiated because of the dismal track record of dismantling racism in the United States.\nTo address these questions, we employ a computational approach combined with in depth case analysis to construct the first longitudinal database on racism and strategies to combat racism world-wide. With attention to the theoretical tenets for addressing racism and under standing minority agency and innovation in face of racial inequity, this extensive collection of empirical evidence situates African Americans, Asian American-Pacific Islanders (AAPI), and Latinx Americans in a larger cross-national group-level database, supplemented with sub-national case study data from across the world."
